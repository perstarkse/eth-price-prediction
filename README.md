____
This repository houses the Lag-Llama architecture.

____

* **Coming Next**: Fine-tuning scripts with examples on real-world datasets and best practices in using Lag-Llama!üöÄ  

<b>Updates</b>:

* **17-Feb-2024**: We have released a new updated [Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XxrLW9VGPlZDw3efTvUi0hQimgJOwQG6?usp=sharing) for zero-shot forecasting that shows how one can load time series of different formats.
* **7-Feb-2024**: We released Lag-Llama, with open-source model checkpoints and a Colab Demo for zero-shot forecasting.

____

Current Features:

üí´ <b>Zero-shot forecasting</b> on a dataset of <b>any frequency</b> for <b>any prediction length</b>, using the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XxrLW9VGPlZDw3efTvUi0hQimgJOwQG6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Colab Demo.</a><br/>

____

Coming Soon:

‚≠ê An <b>online gradio demo</b> where you can upload time series and get zero-shot predictions and perform finetuning.

‚≠ê Features for <b>finetuning</b> the foundation model

‚≠ê Features for <b>pretraining</b> Lag-Llama on your own large-scale data

‚≠ê Scripts to <b>reproduce</b> all results in the paper.
